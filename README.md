**Y axis should be time, not speed

You can see a bar chart with speed calculations of processing with different amount of goroutines. It is clearly visible that no goroutines bar requires the most time, so it is the most uneffective one. As for the fastest one, it is the option with 10 goroutines. I suppose it is the perfect one because 1 goroutine is not effective enough, and 100 and 1000 goroutines require some time/performance measurement for dividingf tasks to so many goroutines.
